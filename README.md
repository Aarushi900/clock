# Clock

This is a simple clock application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application displays two clocks: one showing Indian Standard Time (IST) and the other showing Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

The clocks are created using HTML `div` elements styled with CSS. The hour, minute, and second hands of each clock are positioned using JavaScript based on the current time obtained from the `Date` object.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. The clocks will start running and display the current time for IST and GMT. The hour, minute, and second hands will continuously update every second to reflect the current time.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap (CSS framework)

## Files Included

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the clock application's structure.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the clock application.
- `app.js`: The JavaScript file for updating the clock hands and time.

## Dependencies

The clock application uses the following external dependencies:

- Bootstrap CSS: Included via a CDN link in the HTML file.
- Popper.js and Bootstrap JavaScript: Included via CDN links in the HTML file.

## Acknowledgements

The clock application was created as a simple demonstration and does not provide advanced features. It can be used as a starting point to build more complex clock applications or as a learning resource for understanding basic web development concepts.
